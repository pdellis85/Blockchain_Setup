# Proof of Authority Development Chain

For this assignment, I was given the role of a new developer at a small bank.

My mission will be to set up a testnet blockchain for your organization.

To do this, I will create and submit four deliverables:

* Set up your custom testnet blockchain.

* Send a test transaction.

* Create a repository.

* Write instructions on how to use the chain for the rest of your team.
    * Which can be found here: [An Internal Link](POA-Blockchain-guide.md)

## Background

You have just landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what
blockchain technology can do for them and their customers.

Your first project at the company is to set up a private testnet that you and your team of developers
can use to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.

You have decided on setting up a testnet because:

There is no real money involved, which will give your team of developers the freedom to experiment.

Testnets allows for offline development.

In order to set up a testnet, you will need to use the following skills/tools we learned in class:

* Puppeth, to generate your genesis block.

* Geth, a command-line tool, to create keys, initialize nodes, and connect the nodes together.

* The Clique Proof of Authority algorithm.

Tokens inherently have no value here, so we will provide pre-configured accounts and nodes for easy setup.

After creating the custom development chain, create documentation for others on how to start it using the pre-configured
nodes and accounts. You can name the network anything you want, have fun with it!

Be sure to include any preliminary setup information, such as installing dependencies and environment configuration.
