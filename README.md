# Proof of Authority Development Chain

For this assignment, I was given the role of a new developer at a small bank.

My mission will be to set up a testnet blockchain for your organization.

To do this, I will create and submit four deliverables:

* Set up your custom testnet blockchain.

* Send a test transaction.

* Create a repository.

* Write instructions on how to use the chain for the rest of your team.
    * Which can be found here: [An Internal Link](POA-Blockchain-guide.md)

## Background

You have just landed a new job at ZBank, a small, innovative bank that is interested in exploring what
blockchain technology can do for them and their customers.

Your first project at the company is to set up a private testnet that you and your team of developers
can use to explore potentials for blockchain at ZBank.

You have decided on setting up a testnet because:

There is no real money involved, which will give your team of developers the freedom to experiment.

Testnets allows for offline development.
